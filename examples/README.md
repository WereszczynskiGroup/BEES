# Example BEES Usages

In each of the sub-directories you find here, shell scripts and example data are supplied to reproduce the fitting routines used as examples in the Bowerman *et al.* (In Preparation) manuscript.  These routines include stopping the search routine when overfitting is observed, as well as forcing the program to calculate all possible combinations of states, for fitting both SAS-only and SAS+auxiliary data.
