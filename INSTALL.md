# Installation Instructions for BEES

 1. [Download the appropriate Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
 
 2. After Anaconda is installed, use the `conda` command to download the required Python libraries to run BEES:
    `conda install numpy scipy bokeh mpi4py`
 
 3. Download the `BEES.py` and `bayesian_ensemble_estimator_parallel_routine.py` files and ensure that they are in your local `PATH` and `PYTHONPATH` environment variables.
 
    * You should also ensure that the `BEES.py` file is executable!  On Mac and Linux machines, this can be accomplished by navigating to the folder containing `BEES.py` and then calling: `chmod +x BEES.py`
   
 4. You can now run BEES.py from your command line!
